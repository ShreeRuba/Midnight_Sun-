Git Bash is a command-line interface (CLI) that provides a Unix-like shell on Windows. 
It combines the power of Gitâ€”the version control system, with the command-line capabilities of Bash, which is a popular Unix shell. 
This tool allows Windows users to interact with Git and perform version control tasks using familiar Unix commands. Github is user friendly.
